        <h1>Korean Potatoes</h1>
        <img src="../images/korean-potatoes.jpg">
        <p>Known as Ganja Jorim, these are potatoes cooked down and coated in a sweet
        and savoury glaze that pairs really well with steamed
        rice. Itâ€™s also delicious enjoyed as is.</p>

        <p>The term jorim means simmering something in a sauce until
        the sauce has been absorbed/reduced. Similar to dubu jorim
        (Korean braised tofu), these potatoes are cooked down in a
        braising sauce.</p>

        <p>The potatoes have that nice chewy bite from the skin
        but its insides are very soft. I really love dipping these
        in whatever of the sauce/glaze is left to get more of it
        on the potatoes.</p>
