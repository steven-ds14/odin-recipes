        <h1>Korean Potatoes</h1>
        <img src="../images/korean-potatoes.jpg">
        <p>Known as Ganja Jorim, these are potatoes cooked down and coated in a sweet
        and savoury glaze that pairs really well with steamed
        rice. It’s also delicious enjoyed as is.</p>

        <p>The term jorim means simmering something in a sauce until
        the sauce has been absorbed/reduced. Similar to dubu jorim
        (Korean braised tofu), these potatoes are cooked down in a
        braising sauce.</p>

        <p>The potatoes have that nice chewy bite from the skin
        but its insides are very soft. I really love dipping these
        in whatever of the sauce/glaze is left to get more of it
        on the potatoes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 lb baby potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>5 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Make sure to thoroughly wash your potatoes and brush off any dirt. If your potatoes are larger than a ping pong ball, I recommend slicing these in half.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients for the sauce and then set aside. I like mine more on the savoury side with a generous amount of soy sauce. You can easily adjust this to your taste.</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes on a baking tray and leave to bake for 30-35 minutes at 350F/180C or until the skin of the potatoes are slightly wrinkly and potatoes are almost cooked through.</li>
            <li>After baking/cooking the potatoes, heat a large pan with a lid over medium high heat. Once hot, add the neutral oil.</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes until lightly browned on each side.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium and then pour in the braising sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix the potatoes and then cover the pan.</li>
            <li>Leave to simmer over medium heat for 8-10 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through. The sauce will also slowly thicken from the sugars.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened, add in the rice syrup or other liquid sweetener, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat to medium high until the sauce and sugars start to bubble and then mix the potatoes to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Keep a close eye on the potatoes since they can easily burn from the sugars. Taste the potatoes and feel free to add more liquid sweetener if you’d like.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy warm or cold. Note that the potatoes will stick and clump together due to the glaze as it cools.</li>
            <li>You can refrigerate these potatoes but they’re best enjoyed freshly made.</li>
